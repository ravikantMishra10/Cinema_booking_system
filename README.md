🎬 Movie Ticket Booking System
📌 Project Overview

The Movie Ticket Booking System is a Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) based project that simulates a real-world online cinema ticket reservation platform similar to BookMyShow.

The system allows users to:

Browse available movies

Select show timings

Check seat availability

Book tickets dynamically

The project demonstrates how DSA concepts are used in real applications for efficient data handling and booking management.

🚀 Features
